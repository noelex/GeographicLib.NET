[GeographicLib](https://sourceforge.net/p/geographiclib) is a small set of C++ classes for performing conversions between geographic,
UTM, UPS, MGRS, geocentric, and local cartesian coordinates,for gravity (e.g., EGM2008), geoid height and geomagnetic field (e.g., WMM2020) calculations,
and for solving geodesic problems.

GeographicLib.NET is a native .NET implementation of [GeographicLib](https://sourceforge.net/p/geographiclib) written in pure C#.

## What's different from NETGeographicLib

Unlike NETGeographicLib, GeographicLib.NET is implemented in pure C# without binding the C++ GeograpbicLib library by using C++/CLI or P/Invoke, thus achieves higher level of portability.

You should be able to use GeographicLib.NET with any target framework and platform that supports .NET Standard 2.0 or above.

## Features
Bellow is a list of implemented features.
 - [x] Projections (`AlbersEqualArea`, `AzimuthalEquidistant`, `CassiniSoldner`, `Gnomonic`, `LambertConformalConic`, `PolarStereographic` and `TransverseMercator`)
 - [x] Geocodes (`GARS`, `Geohash`, `Georef`, `MGRS` and `OSGB`)
 - [x] Coordinate conversions (`UTMUPS`, `Geocentric` and `LocalCartesian`)
 - [x] Coordinate parsing/formatting (`DMS` and `GeoCoords`)
 - [x] Geodesic (`Geodesic`, `GeodesicLine`, `GeodesicExact` and `GeodesicLineExact`)
 - [x] Geodesic intersections (`Intersect`)
 - [x] Rhumb (`Rhumb` and `RhumbLine`)
 - [x] PolygonArea (`PolygonArea<T>`, `PolygonArea`, `PolygonAreaExact` and `PolygonAreaRhumb`)
 - [x] Geoid (`Geoid`)
 - [x] GravityModel (`GravityCircle`, `NormalGravity` and `GravityModel`)
 - [x] MagneticModel (`MagneticModel`, `MagneticCircle`)
 - [x] Auxiliary classes (`MathEx`, `Ellipoid`, `EllipticFunction`, `SphericalHarmonic`, `AuxAngle`, `AuxLatitude` and `DAuxLatitude`)

`Geodesic` and `GeodesicExact` are tested with the [test set for geodesic](https://zenodo.org/record/32156#.YCFzsFBLQ_0).

`TransverseMercator` and `TransverseMercatorExact` are tested with data generated by 64-bit `TransverseMercatorProj` utility ran on Windows.

Managed implemetation of C mathematical functions in `MathEx` are tested with data generated by 64-bit Windows Universal C Runtime.

## Usage
This section lists some common usage examples of GeographicLib.NET. For detailed documentation, please refer [GeographicLib's documentation](https://geographiclib.sourceforge.io/C++/doc/index.html).
### Inverse calculation
Distance from JFK to LHR.
```csharp
double
  lat1 = 40.6, lon1 = -73.8, // JFK Airport
  lat2 = 51.6, lon2 = -0.5;  // LHR Airport

double arcLength = Geodesic.WGS84.Inverse(lat1, lon1, lat2, lon2, out double distance);
```
### Direct calculation
The point 5500 km NE of JFK:
```csharp
double
  lat1 = 40.6, lon1 = -73.8,
  s12 = 5500e3, azi1 = 51;

double arcLength = Geodesic.WGS84.Direct(lat1, lon1, azi1, s12, out double lat2, out double lon2);
```
### Geodesic intersection
Find closest intersection of two geodesics:
```csharp
Geodesic geod = Geodesic.WGS84;
Intersect inter = new Intersect(geod);
IGeodesicLine
    lineX = geod.Line(0, 0, 45),
    lineY = geod.Line(45, 10, 135);

// Find displacement to closest intersection.
// Where point.X is the displacement from the starting point of lineX,
// and point.Y is the displacement from the starting point of lineY.
Point point = inter.Closest(lineX, lineY);

// Get the position of the intersection point by using the displacement on lineX.
lineX.Position(point.X, out double latx, out double lonx);

// Get the position of the intersection point by using the displacement on lineY.
lineY.Position(point.Y, out double laty, out double lony);

// (latx, lonx) and (laty, lony) should be pointing to the same location.
// Assert.AreEqual(latx, laty, 1e-12);
// Assert.AreEqual(lonx, lony, 1e-12);
```

## Mathematical Functions
GeographicLib uses several C mathematical functions that are not available in all versions of .NET. These functions are:
 - remquo
 - frexp
 - sincos (available since .NET 7.0, but not used due to [this issue](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/48776))
 - hypot (available since .NET 7.0, but not used due to [this issue](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/75651))
 - log1p (a naive implementation is available since .NET 7.0, not used by GeographicLib.NET)
 - expm1 (a naive implementation is available since .NET 7.0, not used by GeographicLib.NET)
 - exp2 (a naive implementation is available since .NET 7.0, not used by GeographicLib.NET)
 - log2 (available since .NET 5.0)
 - fma (available since .NET 5.0)
 - scalbn (available since .NET 5.0)
 - copysign (available since .NET 5.0)
 - atanh (available since .NET Standard 2.1)
 - asinh (available since .NET Standard 2.1)
 - cbrt (available since .NET Standard 2.1)

GeographicLib.NET provides managed implementations of these functions (ported from [musl libc](https://musl.libc.org/)).

`GeographicLib.MathEx` class will use implementations provided by .NET runtime whenever possible, and will fallback to managed implementations when not available in .NET runtime. 

You can also force `GeographicLib.MathEx` to fallback to platform dependent implementations provided by system C runtime libraries,
rather than managed implementations, by setting `GeographicLib.MathEx.UseManagedCMath` property to `false`.
Native C math implemenation may provide slightly better performance, but also produce inconsistent results on different platforms in some edge cases.

In fact, the performance of different C math implementations are very close, managed implementation performs even better on newer runtimes. The following table shows the benchmark result of `Geodesic.WGS84.GenDirect` executed with/without manged C math:

Thus it's recommended to stick with managed C math until it becomes a performance bottleneck of your application, as it's more consistent as compared to native C math on different platforms.

## Change Log
GeographicLib.NET adopts changes made in GeographicLib and aligns its version number with GeographicLib releases.

Bellow is a list of stable releases of GeographicLib.NET and changes made in .NET side in each release.

    number and date time formats provided by `CultureInfo.CurrentCulture`. This fixes [issue #27](https://github.com/noelex/GeographicLib.NET/issues/27).

### Version 2.0.0 (released 2022/08/24)
- **NEW**
  - Add `IPolygonArea` interface to provide better support for unit testing and dependency injection.
  - Add `Count` and `IsPolyline` properties (corresponding to `NumPoints` and `Polyline` methods in GeographicLib) to `PolygonArea`.
  - Add a new method `Utility.FractionalYear` which can parse floating point number and date time string as fractional year.
  - [Allow constructing `Geoid` from `Stream` and byte array](https://github.com/noelex/GeographicLib.NET/discussions/22).
- **FIX**
  - String accepting APIs now handle lowercase "nan" correctly.
  - Ensure consistent rounding mode (`MidpointRounding.ToEven`) across different runtimes when converting floating point number to string.

  - Modify overloads of `Forward` and `Reverse` in `AlbersEqualArea`, `AzimuthalEquidistant`, `CassiniSoldner` and `LambertConformalConic` to return coordinates as tuples.
  - Modify methods using `out` parameters defined in `NormalGravity`, `GravityModel`, `GravityCircle`, `MagneticModel` and `MagnegticCircle` to return results as tuples.

- **NEW**
  - Add constructor overloads that accept `IEllipsoid` as parameter for `AlbersEqualArea` and `LambertConformalConic`.
  - Add managed implementation of `log2`.
  - Add overloads of `Direct` and `Inverse` in `Geodesic`/`GeodesicLine`, `GeodesicExact`/`GeodesicLineExact` and `Rhumb`/`RhumbLineExact`,
    that return the computation results as a single object.
  - Add definitions of popular reference ellipsoids in `Ellipsoid` class.

- **FIX**
  - Fix stack overflow bug for `Forward(double lon0, double lat, double lon)` and `Reverse(double lon0, double x, double y)` in `TransverseMercatorExact`.
