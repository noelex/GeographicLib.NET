[GeographicLib](https://sourceforge.net/p/geographiclib) is a small set of C++ classes for performing conversions between geographic,
UTM, UPS, MGRS, geocentric, and local cartesian coordinates,for gravity (e.g., EGM2008), geoid height and geomagnetic field (e.g., WMM2020) calculations,
and for solving geodesic problems.

GeographicLib.NET is a native .NET implementation of [GeographicLib](https://sourceforge.net/p/geographiclib) written in pure C#.

## What's different from NETGeographicLib

Unlike NETGeographicLib, GeographicLib.NET is implemented in pure C# without binding the C++ GeograpbicLib library by using C++/CLI or P/Invoke, thus achieves higher level of portability.

You should be able to use GeographicLib.NET with any target framework and platform that supports .NET Standard 2.0 or above.

## Features
Bellow is a list of implemented features.
 - [x] Projections (`AlbersEqualArea`, `AzimuthalEquidistant`, `CassiniSoldner`, `Gnomonic`, `LambertConformalConic`, `PolarStereographic` and `TransverseMercator`)
 - [x] Geocodes (`GARS`, `Geohash`, `Georef`, `MGRS` and `OSGB`)
 - [x] Coordinate conversions (`UTMUPS`, `Geocentric` and `LocalCartesian`)
 - [x] Coordinate parsing/formatting (`DMS` and `GeoCoords`)
 - [x] Geodesic (`Geodesic`, `GeodesicLine`, `GeodesicExact` and `GeodesicLineExact`)
 - [x] Geodesic intersections (`Intersect`)
 - [x] Rhumb (`Rhumb` and `RhumbLine`)
 - [x] PolygonArea (`PolygonArea<T>`, `PolygonArea`, `PolygonAreaExact` and `PolygonAreaRhumb`)
 - [x] Geoid (`Geoid`)
 - [x] GravityModel (`GravityCircle`, `NormalGravity` and `GravityModel`)
 - [x] MagneticModel (`MagneticModel`, `MagneticCircle`)
 - [x] Auxilary classes (`MathEx`, `Ellipoid`, `EllipticFunction`, `SphericalHarmonic`, `AuxAngle`, `AuxLatitude` and `DAuxLatitude`)

`Geodesic` and `GeodesicExact` are tested with the [test set for geodesic](https://zenodo.org/record/32156#.YCFzsFBLQ_0).

`TransverseMercator` and `TransverseMercatorExact` are tested with data generated by 64-bit `TransverseMercatorProj` utility ran on Windows.

Managed implemetation of C mathematical functions in `MathEx` are tested with data generated by 64-bit Windows Universal C Runtime.

## Mathematical Functions
GeographicLib uses several C mathematical functions that are not available in all versions of .NET. These functions are:
 - remquo
 - frexp
 - sincos (available since .NET 7.0, but not used due to [this issue](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/48776))
 - hypot (available since .NET 7.0, but not used due to [this issue](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/75651))
 - log1p (a naive implementation is available since .NET 7.0, not used by GeographicLib.NET)
 - expm1 (a naive implementation is available since .NET 7.0, not used by GeographicLib.NET)
 - exp2 (a naive implementation is available since .NET 7.0, not used by GeographicLib.NET)
 - log2 (available since .NET 5.0)
 - fma (available since .NET 5.0)
 - scalbn (available since .NET 5.0)
 - copysign (available since .NET 5.0)
 - atanh (available since .NET Standard 2.1)
 - asinh (available since .NET Standard 2.1)
 - cbrt (available since .NET Standard 2.1)

GeographicLib.NET provides managed implementations of these functions (ported from [musl libc](https://musl.libc.org/)).

`GeographicLib.MathEx` class will use implementations provided by .NET runtime whenever possible, and will fallback to managed implementations when not available in .NET runtime. 

You can also force `GeographicLib.MathEx` to fallback to platform dependent implementations provided by system C runtime libraries,
rather than managed implementations, by setting `GeographicLib.MathEx.UseManagedCMath` property to `false`.
Native C math implemenation may provide slightly better performance, but also produce inconsistent results on different platforms in some edge cases.

In fact, the performance of different C math implementations are very close, managed implementation performs even better on newer runtimes. The following table shows the benchmark result of `Geodesic.WGS84.GenDirect` executed with/without manged C math:

Thus it's recommended to stick with managed C math until it becomes a performance bottleneck of your application, as it's more consistent as compared to native C math on different platforms.
## Documentation
GeographicLib.NET includes a detailed XML documentation for all public APIs.
Since the API surface of GeographicLib.NET is highly compatible with GeographicLib,
you can also refer the its documentation [here](https://geographiclib.sourceforge.io/html/index.html) for usage and detailed explanation.

## Change Log
GeographicLib.NET adopts changes made in GeographicLib and aligns its version number with GeographicLib releases.

Bellow is a list of stable releases of GeographicLib.NET and changes made in .NET side in each release.
For changes adopted from GeographicLib, please refer the its change log [here](https://geographiclib.sourceforge.io/C++/doc/changes.html).

### Version 2.3.0 (unreleased)
- **NEW**
  - Target .NET 7.0 and .NET 8.0.
  - Add managed implementation and libc wrapper for exp2.
  - Managed implementations and libc wrappers for log1p, expm1 and exp2 are now used for all versions of .NET, because the implementations provided by .NET runtime are just wrappers over `Math.Log` and `Math.Pow`.
- **FIX**
  - [PolygonAreaExact seems to give incorrect results](https://github.com/noelex/GeographicLib.NET/issues/29).

### Version 2.1.2 (released 2023/01/17)
- **FIX**
  - Fixed an issue where number and date time parsing may fail or produce unexpected result when working with 
    number and date time formats provided by `CultureInfo.CurrentCulture`. This fixes [issue #27](https://github.com/noelex/GeographicLib.NET/issues/27).

### Version 2.0.0 (released 2022/08/24)
- **NEW**
  - Add `IPolygonArea` interface to provide better support for unit testing and dependency injection.
  - Add `Count` and `IsPolyline` properties (corresponding to `NumPoints` and `Polyline` methods in GeographicLib) to `PolygonArea`.
  - Add a new method `Utility.FractionalYear` which can parse floating point number and date time string as fractional year.
  - [Allow constructing `Geoid` from `Stream` and byte array](https://github.com/noelex/GeographicLib.NET/discussions/22).
- **FIX**
  - String accepting APIs now handle lowercase "nan" correctly.
  - Ensure consistent rounding mode (`MidpointRounding.ToEven`) across different runtimes when converting floating point number to string.
  - `MGRS.Reverse` now allows lowercase input.

### Version 1.52.1 (released 2022/04/12)
- **NEW**
  - Target .NET 6.0 in addition to .NET 5.0, .NET Standard 2.1 and .NET Standard 2.0.
  - [Source Link](https://github.com/dotnet/sourcelink) support.

- **BREAKING**
  - Fixed typos in `Ellipsoid`. (Renamed `SecondFlatterning` to `SecondFlattening` and `ThirdFlatterning` to `ThirdFlattening`)

- **FIX**
  - Fixed an issue that `Freeze` method in `AlbersEqualArea`, `LambertConformalConic` and `PolarStereographic` was not working correctly.
  - Fixed duplicate instantiation of `WGS84` and `GRS80` static properties defined in `NormalGravity`.
  - [Add missing support for World Magnetic Model Format v2](https://github.com/noelex/GeographicLib.NET/issues/17).

### Version 1.52.0 (released 2021/07/07)
- **BREAKING**
  - Modify overloads of `Forward` and `Reverse` in `AlbersEqualArea`, `AzimuthalEquidistant`, `CassiniSoldner` and `LambertConformalConic` to return coordinates as tuples.
  - Modify methods using `out` parameters defined in `NormalGravity`, `GravityModel`, `GravityCircle`, `MagneticModel` and `MagnegticCircle` to return results as tuples.

- **NEW**
  - Add constructor overloads that accept `IEllipsoid` as parameter for `AlbersEqualArea` and `LambertConformalConic`.
  - Add managed implementation of `log2`.
  - Add overloads of `Direct` and `Inverse` in `Geodesic`/`GeodesicLine`, `GeodesicExact`/`GeodesicLineExact` and `Rhumb`/`RhumbLineExact`,
    that return the computation results as a single object.
  - Add definitions of popular reference ellipsoids in `Ellipsoid` class.

- **FIX**
  - Fix stack overflow bug for `Forward(double lon0, double lat, double lon)` and `Reverse(double lon0, double x, double y)` in `TransverseMercatorExact`.

### Version 1.51.0 (released 2021/03/14)
Initial stable release.
