GeographicLib.NET is a native .NET implementation of [GeographicLib](https://sourceforge.net/p/geographiclib) written in pure C#.

## What's different from NETGeographicLib

Unlike the original NETGeographicLib, GeographicLib.NET is implemented in pure C# without binding the original C++ GeograpbicLib library by using C++/CLI or P/Invoke, thus achieves higher level of portability.

You should be able to use GeographicLib.NET with any target framework and platform that supports .NET Standard 2.0 or above.

## Features
Bellow is a list of planned and implemented features.
 - [x] Projections (`AlbersEqualArea`, `AzimuthalEquidistant`, `CassiniSoldner`, `Gnomonic`, `LambertConformalConic`, `PolarStereographic` and `TransverseMercator`)
 - [x] Geocodes (`GARS`, `Geohash`, `Georef`, `MGRS` and `OSGB`)
 - [x] Coordinate conversions (`UTMUPS`, `Geocentric` and `LocalCartesian`)
 - [x] Coordinate parsing/formatting (`DMS` and `GeoCoords`)
 - [x] Geodesic (`Geodesic`, `GeodesicLine`, `GeodesicExact` and `GeodesicLineExact`)
 - [x] Rhumb (`Rhumb`, `RhumbLine`)
 - [x] PolygonArea (`PolygonArea<T>`, `PolygonArea`, `PolygonAreaExact` and `PolygonAreaRhumb`)
 - [x] Geoid (`Geoid`)
 - [x] GravityModel (`GravityCircle`, `NormalGravity` and `GravityModel`)
 - [x] MagneticModel (`MagneticModel`, `MagneticCircle`)
 - [x] Auxilary classes (`MathEx`, `Ellipoid`, `EllipticFunction` and `SphericalHarmonic`)

`Geodesic` and `GeodesicExact` are tested with the [test set for geodesic](https://zenodo.org/record/32156#.YCFzsFBLQ_0).

`TransverseMercator` and `TransverseMercatorExact` are tested with data generated by 64-bit `TransverseMercatorProj` utility ran on Windows.

Managed implemetation of C mathematical functions in `MathEx` are tested with data generated by 64-bit Windows Universal C Runtime.

## Installing
### Stable ![Release](https://buildstats.info/nuget/GeographicLib.NET?includePreReleases=false)
Stable releases of GeographicLib.NET are hosted on NuGet.
You can install them using the following command:
```
dotnet add package GeographicLib.NET
```

### Preview ![Preview](https://buildstats.info/nuget/GeographicLib.NET?includePreReleases=true)
Preview versions of GeographicLib.NET are hosted on NuGet pre-release channel.
You can install them using the following command:

```
dotnet add package GeographicLib.NET --prerelease
```

## Mathematical Functions
GeographicLib uses several C mathematical functions that are not present in or not available in all versions of .NET. These functions are:
 - remquo
 - hypot
 - log1p
 - expm1
 - frexp
 - fma (available since .NET 5.0)
 - scalbn (available since .NET 5.0)
 - copysign (available since .NET 5.0)
 - atanh (available since .NET Standard 2.1)
 - asinh (available since .NET Standard 2.1)
 - cbrt (available since .NET Standard 2.1)

GeographicLib.NET provides managed implemetations of these functions (ported from [musl libc](https://musl.libc.org/)).

`GeographicLib.MathEx` class will use implemetations provided by .NET runtime whenenver possible, and will fallback to managed implemetations when not available in .NET runtime. 

You can also force `GeographicLib.MathEx` to fallback to native implemations provided by system C runtime libraries,
rather than managed implementaions, by setting `GeographicLib.MathEx.UseManagedCMath` property to `false`.
These functions provide better performance, but may produce completely different results in some edge cases.

## Documentation
GeographicLib.NET includes a detailed XML documentation for all public APIs.
Since the API surface of GeographicLib.NET is highly compatible with the original GeographicLib,
you can also refer the original documentation [here](https://geographiclib.sourceforge.io/html/index.html) for usage and explanation.
