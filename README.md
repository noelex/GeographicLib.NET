[GeographicLib](https://sourceforge.net/p/geographiclib) is a small set of C++ classes for performing conversions between geographic,
UTM, UPS, MGRS, geocentric, and local cartesian coordinates,for gravity (e.g., EGM2008), geoid height and geomagnetic field (e.g., WMM2020) calculations,
and for solving geodesic problems.

GeographicLib.NET is a native .NET implementation of [GeographicLib](https://sourceforge.net/p/geographiclib) written in pure C#.

## What's different from NETGeographicLib

Unlike NETGeographicLib, GeographicLib.NET is implemented in pure C# without binding the C++ GeograpbicLib library by using C++/CLI or P/Invoke, thus achieves higher level of portability.

You should be able to use GeographicLib.NET with any target framework and platform that supports .NET Standard 2.0 or above.

## Features
Bellow is a list of implemented features.
 - [x] Projections (`AlbersEqualArea`, `AzimuthalEquidistant`, `CassiniSoldner`, `Gnomonic`, `LambertConformalConic`, `PolarStereographic` and `TransverseMercator`)
 - [x] Geocodes (`GARS`, `Geohash`, `Georef`, `MGRS` and `OSGB`)
 - [x] Coordinate conversions (`UTMUPS`, `Geocentric` and `LocalCartesian`)
 - [x] Coordinate parsing/formatting (`DMS` and `GeoCoords`)
 - [x] Geodesic (`Geodesic`, `GeodesicLine`, `GeodesicExact` and `GeodesicLineExact`)
 - [x] Rhumb (`Rhumb` and `RhumbLine`)
 - [x] PolygonArea (`PolygonArea<T>`, `PolygonArea`, `PolygonAreaExact` and `PolygonAreaRhumb`)
 - [x] Geoid (`Geoid`)
 - [x] GravityModel (`GravityCircle`, `NormalGravity` and `GravityModel`)
 - [x] MagneticModel (`MagneticModel`, `MagneticCircle`)
 - [x] Auxilary classes (`MathEx`, `Ellipoid`, `EllipticFunction` and `SphericalHarmonic`)

`Geodesic` and `GeodesicExact` are tested with the [test set for geodesic](https://zenodo.org/record/32156#.YCFzsFBLQ_0).

`TransverseMercator` and `TransverseMercatorExact` are tested with data generated by 64-bit `TransverseMercatorProj` utility ran on Windows.

Managed implemetation of C mathematical functions in `MathEx` are tested with data generated by 64-bit Windows Universal C Runtime.

## Mathematical Functions
GeographicLib uses several C mathematical functions that are not available in all versions of .NET. These functions are:
 - remquo
 - hypot
 - log1p
 - expm1
 - frexp
 - log2 (available since .NET 5.0)
 - fma (available since .NET 5.0)
 - scalbn (available since .NET 5.0)
 - copysign (available since .NET 5.0)
 - atanh (available since .NET Standard 2.1)
 - asinh (available since .NET Standard 2.1)
 - cbrt (available since .NET Standard 2.1)

GeographicLib.NET provides managed implementations of these functions (ported from [musl libc](https://musl.libc.org/)).

`GeographicLib.MathEx` class will use implementations provided by .NET runtime whenever possible, and will fallback to managed implementations when not available in .NET runtime. 

You can also force `GeographicLib.MathEx` to fallback to platform dependent implementations provided by system C runtime libraries,
rather than managed implementations, by setting `GeographicLib.MathEx.UseManagedCMath` property to `false`.
Native C math implemenation may provide slightly better performance, but also produce inconsistent results on different platforms in some edge cases.

In fact, the performance of different C math implementations are very close, managed implementation performs even better on newer runtimes. The following table shows the benchmark result of `Geodesic.WGS84.GenDirect` executed with/without manged C math:

Thus it's recommended to stick with managed C math until it becomes a performance bottleneck of your application, as it's more consistent as compared to native C math on different platforms.
## Documentation
GeographicLib.NET includes a detailed XML documentation for all public APIs.
Since the API surface of GeographicLib.NET is highly compatible with GeographicLib,
you can also refer the its documentation [here](https://geographiclib.sourceforge.io/html/index.html) for usage and detailed explanation.
